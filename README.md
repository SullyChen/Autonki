# Autonki
By popular demand, the code for the GPT-powered Anki deck creator that I hosted at the beginning of MS1! I've updated the code so that it works with the most recent OpenAI API. I'm not a web designer and most of the front-end code was written by ChatGPT (the original release, back in 2022!), so please excuse the horrendous code quality. I'm releasing this code since many wanted to use it, but I'm not planning on hosting or maintaining it anymore.

If you use this for academic research need to cite it for any reason, please cite this repo as "Autonki" by Sully F. Chen!

## Usage
You must first download [GenAnki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki), but other than that, it's just a simple Flask app. You can run it with `python main_v4.py`. Make sure you set your API key in the `main_v4.py` file!
